## Prompt

You've been hired by an investment firm to make a data dashboard to support their investment decision-making capabilities.

The dashboard should allow a user to select from a predefined list of valid stock symbols, and click a button to fetch information about that stock.

The dashboard should then display the selected stocks' latest closing price, and a line chart depicting its closing prices over time.

## Requirements

After a user inputs their API Key and selects a stock and clicks the "Go" button, the dashboard should:
  1) Capture these input values
  2) Compile the right URL given the provided inputs
  3) Fetch data from that URL
  4) Crunch the data
  5) Overwrite the HTML display values (symbol, latest close)
  6) Make a dataviz of closing prices over time

If you can't do all of these in the time provided, do as much as you can.

## Instructions

### Setting up the Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub, then download or "clone" the repository onto your local computer, then open the repository in a text editor, create a new "index.html" file, and paste inside the [provided "index.html" starter code](index.html).

Preview this file in the browser to see the form inputs and placeholder outputs.

### Developing

Use your JavaScript knowledge to iteratively develop the contents of your "index.html" page to tackle the objectives.

You may modify the page's HTML contents if necessary, although it might not be necessary.

### Deploying

Finally, configure GitHub Pages to host your website so it is publicly-accessible over the Internet.

Then share your link with the rest of the class via Slack to show off your great work!
