# React.js Framework Overview

## React Resources

Here is a [Getting Started Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), and a perhaps more helpful guide about [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html). It is important to read about [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), how [State](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) is managed, and about the [Component Event Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html). 

## External Resources

There are lots of great [Youtube Videos about React by WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wZoGFF_oi4&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH_NT5zPVp18nGe_W9LqBDQK), including [Learn React in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY).

## Creating React Apps from Scratch

If you want to generate a new app from scratch, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a great choice.

## Starting from a Template

You can also feel free to leverage the professor's [React Starter App with Firebase Auth](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/react-firebase-auth-template-2021) as a template, and extend from there.
